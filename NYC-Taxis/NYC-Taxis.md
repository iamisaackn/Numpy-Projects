# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of taxi rides in New York City. The data is stored in a CSV file named 'nyc_taxis.csv'. The analysis is performed using the numpy library in Python.

## Code Questions

1. **Calculate the mean speed of the rides**: The speed for each ride is calculated by dividing the distance by the time (transformed from seconds to hours). The mean speed is then calculated from these values.

2. **Find the number of rides taken in February**: The code filters out the rides that were taken in February and counts them.

3. **Find the number of rides where tips are more than $50**: The code filters out the rides where the tip was more than $50 and counts them.

4. **Find the number of rides where the drop-off location was JFK airport**: The code filters out the rides where the drop-off location was JFK airport and counts them.

## Results

The results of the analysis are printed to the console.
